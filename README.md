# Applied Category Theory Seminar <br> WiSe 2025 Uni Greifswald

This is teaching material for the course "Kategorientheorie in den Naturwissenschaften" (Category Theory in the Natural Sciences).

For further details check out the [*syllabus*](https://github.com/nimarasekh/ACT-WiSe25/blob/master/Syllabus_ACT_Wi2025.pdf).

## Background Material and References

We first focus on basic categorical concepts (such as categories, functors, natural transformation). Here are some good sources:

There are also some good resources on category theory from an applied perspective:

2. J. Baez, *Applied Category Theory Course*, lecture notes [available online](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/act_course/)

## Talk Topics

Every student should pick a subject based on the list in the syllabus and prepare a talk addressing four questions:

1. Background material related to the application.
2. Relevant categorical background.
3. How category theory is applied in this particular context.
4. Whether the categorical application is in fact useful.
